# BIPARTITE-GRAPHS

The graph is called BIPARTITE if following condition is satisfied:
1 - If the graph contains cycle in it then it is of even length.
2-  If we divide the graph into two sets such that the vertices in set 1 and vertices in edge 2 if we make edges alternatively then they are of diff sets.
3-  Take the alternate levels of a graph vertices in diff sets.
4- No two consequitive vertices have same colors.
